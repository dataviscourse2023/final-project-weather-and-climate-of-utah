                    In the mountainous western United States, terrain significantly influences 
                    precipitation totals and temperature. Typically, precipitation will increase
                    with elevation due to high terrain, forcing the precipitating air masses to ascend. 
                    The forced ascent will cause the air mass to cool, increase condensation and the 
                    formulation of raindrops, and then precipitation totals will increase. This 
                    creates a strong contrast between the relatively wetter mountainous regions and 
                    the drier valleys.

                <p>
                    Temperatures decrease with elevation due to the decrease in air pressure, which allows air to expand and causes a cooling effect. 
                    On a global average, temperature decreases altitudinally by 6.5°C per kilometer. This rate decreases when observing temperatures 
                    along a slope due to the mountain surface warming the air above it. Previous research in 
                    the western United States has estimated the rate of decrease in temperature with elevation 
                    to range between 3.9°C and 5.2°C per kilometer.

                        During the warm-season months (defined as May - October), increased temperatures can result in enhanced wildfire
                        activity across the western continental United States. Thus, for emergency personnel, it can be helpful to know
                        if there's a historical trend in wildfire activity with temperature to plan for increased mitigation efforts in future years.
                        Here, we show a time series of warm-season temperature averaged across all sites with the size of each point 
                        scaled by the number of acres burned by wildfires in Utah each year.

            <h3>Great Salt Lake Water Elevation and Cool Season Precipitation</h3>

                        Cool-season precipitation totals heavily influence the water elevation of the Great Salt Lake. During the 
                        cooler months, shown here from November to April for stations within the Great Salt Lake's drainage basin, 
                        precipitation accumulates as snow in mountainous regions. 
                        This snowpack is a critical water source for the lake as it 
                        gradually melts in the warmer months, 
                        contributing to the Great Salt Lake's water level. However, variations in 
                        cool-season precipitation greatly impact the lake's elevation. 
                        Years with above-average snowfall lead to increased freshwater inflow to the lake, elevating its levels and supporting the 
                        migratory bird population. Conversely, drier winters result in reduced 
                        inflow, potentially causing a decline in water elevation,  
                        altering the lake's shoreline, and increasing the lake's salinity to the 
                        detriment of the brine shrimp and migratory birds.
